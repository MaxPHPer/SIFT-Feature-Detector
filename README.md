# SIFT-Feature-Detector
Program to stitch together two images into a single image (OpenCV - Python) by matching SIFT features. 
Steps: Detect SIFT features and compute descriptors separately for the two images. Find robust corresponding features using Flann-based matcher. Calculate homography matrix and merge images after perspective transformation.
Used OpenCV in Python.
